Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/aeryan/spotify-music-analysis/data
This dataset contains Spotify hit songs, including their basic information as well as some quantified judgements of the songs including loudness, dancibility, etc.
As a music fan, by analyzing this dataset, I would like to see if there is in general shared traits among songs in this list based on the numerical measurement included. I am also interested in viewing the distribution of these songs' features.
